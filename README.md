# Piezoelectricity Codebase

This repository contains the code base for the 3D finite element implementation of piezoelectricity used in Chapter 3 of my M.S. thesis for the Mechanical Engineering department at MIT. This thesis is publicly available from the MIT libraries (https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/139556).

The repository contains all the relevant Abaqus UEL and input files for the piezoelectricity studies presented in my thesis. The theory implemented is a finite strain coupled electro-mechanical theory for piezoelectricity, and as such is broadly useful for modeling piezoelectricity problems with moderately large strains but arbitrarily large rotations.

I have also included a useful Excel spreadsheet of the material properties for the piezoelectric materials considered in my thesis work, and a .pdf writeup of how to create new analyses for the piezoelectricity UEL.
