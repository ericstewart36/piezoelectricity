# piezoelectricity

This repository contains the code base for the 3D finite element implementation of piezoelectricity used in Chapter 3 of my M.S. thesis for the Mechanical Engineering department at MIT.

The repository contains all the relevant Abaqus UEL and input files for the piezoelectricity studies presented in my thesis. The theory implemented is a finite strain coupled electro-mechanical theory for piezoelectricity, and as such is broadly useful for modeling piezoelectricity problems with moderately large strains but arbitrarily large rotations.

I have also included a useful Excel spreadsheet of the material properties for the piezoelectric materials considered in my thesis work, and a .pdf writeup of how to create new analyses for the piezoelectricity UEL.
